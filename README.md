# Tweeter Project

Welcome to Tweeter! The world's GREATEST SINGLE-PAGE TWITTER CLONE, (according to at least 1 person and soon more).

Please come join the non-stop action packed adventure that is this single page Tweet app. 
Want to post a new Tweet and then see it instantly? You got it. You want to see a list of all previous tweets? We'll do you one better, we'll show all the previous tweets in reverse chronological order! 
Is that not enough for you? Well, we hope you like shadow boxes, because that's what you'll get on each previous tweet upon inspection. Just hover your cursor over the tweet to see that shadow magic. 
Still not impressed? Well we hope you didn't pay full price admission because you'll only be using the edge of your seat once you witness the gloriousness that is the hidden slide-down/slide-up post form! You read that correctly, click on "WRITE a new tweet" and like magic your new tweet form appears out of nowhere. Do the same to make it vanish.
The fun doesn't end there, try hovering over the "flag", "retweet', and "like" buttons, and watch as they change color.

Tweeter was not only designed for the desktop demographic. We have implemented resizing CSS to accomodate for smaller devices such as tablets. Don't believe us? Try changing your browser window.

This app was built using HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and by using Node, Express and back-end skills.
